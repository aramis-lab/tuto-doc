GitHub Pages
============

`GitHub Pages <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart>`_ offers a really easy way to deploy
your documentation.

To use this functionality, go on the GitHub of your forked repository, then go to
**Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source**, and select **GitHub Actions**.

We won't go into the details, but a `GitHub Action <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_ is a
**task that is triggered every time a certain event occurs**. The task and the triggering event are defined
in a **workflow**, that you put in the ``.github/workflows`` folder of your repository.

Here our task is "building and deploying the documentation", and our event is "every time I push on
the ``main`` branch".

Well, here is the **workflow** associated to this action:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: documentation

    on:
        push:
            branches: ["main"]

    permissions:
        contents: read
        pages: write
        id-token: write

    jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v4
                - uses: snok/install-poetry@v1
                - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
                    with:
                        python-version: '3.12'
                - name: Install package
                    run: poetry install
                - name: Sphinx build
                    run: poetry run sphinx-build -M html docs docs/_build
                - name: Upload artifact
                    uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
                    with:
                        path: docs/_build/html

        deploy:
            environment:
                name: github-pages
                url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            needs: build
            steps:
                - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
                    id: deployment
                    uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

.. important::
    It is important to tell GitHub to only trigger the workflow when we push on
    our ``main`` branch. Otherwise, if we work on other branches, for example to develop
    a new feature, the public documentation will change every time we push something on
    these branches. So, with GitHub Pages, **make sure your public documentation relies on the most stable
    branch**.

In your forked repository, you already have this workflow in ``.github/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml`` of your ``main``
branch, so no need to add it.

Nevertheless, workflows may not be activated in a forked repository. To activate them, in your forked GitHub repo,
go to **Actions**. If you have the message "Workflows aren't being run on this forked repository", click on
**I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**.

Lastly, to trigger the deployment, you may need to push something on your ``main`` branch. So, just push
an empty commit with ``git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"`` and ``git push``.

The deployment can take some time, but once it is finished,
your documentation should be available at ``https://<github-username>.github.io/tuto-doc``!

As you just saw, GitHub Pages makes it very easy to publicly deploy your documentation. But there is one
main drawback: **there can be only one version of your documentation**. More precisely:

- you can't have different documentations for different branches;
- once you have updated your main branch, you can't see the old versions of the documentation.

It can be a real handicap if you plan to maintain your package regularly, because the users won't
use necessarily the latest version of your code.

A great alternative that handles versioning is :doc:`Read the Docs <read_the_docs>`.
